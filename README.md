# ToDoList-Js
Project: ToDoList

implementation of a "To Do" list

features:
* add new tasks
* mark completed tasks
* remove tasks
* alert the user when there is an attempt to add an empty task

what I learned:
* how to save the data in the browser (exiting the page does not remove the tasks)
* how to toggle between classes
* manipulate the DOM using JavaScript
